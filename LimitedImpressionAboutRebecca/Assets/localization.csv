SAY.Chapter1.2405.Protagonist,,Can  you tell me more about Rebecca? She seems very popular among students?,
SAY.Chapter1.2406.Sophie,,"Of course! She is almost a legend in my grade. It's hard for me to explain by language, but wherever she is she can always take everybody's concentration.",
SAY.Chapter1.2619.Protagonist,,That sounds like any ordinary school diva. Is it enough to make you admire her? ,
SAY.Chapter1.2620.Sophie,,"No, it's a pity that you can never meet her again. She has a spirit of sacrifying and no matter what you ask, she definity would find a way to help you.",
SAY.Chapter1.2621.Sophie,,Maybe for her responding wishes from people is her responsibility. Sometimes it was tired but she never say no to us.,
SAY.Chapter1.2413.Protagonist,,Do you familiar with Rebecca's boyfriend Antony?,
SAY.Chapter1.2415.Sophie,,Ehh...... The only thing I could say is that Rebecca met the wrong person at a wrong time.,
SAY.Chapter1.2622.Sophie,,She was totally addicted in this relationship and almost be manipulated by Antony.,
SAY.Chapter1.2416.Protagonist,,What do you mean being manipulated?,
SAY.Chapter1.2417.Sophie,,Antony knows Rebecca is such gentle and kind person so he definitly used some tricks to make her obey his order.,
SAY.Chapter1.2419.Sophie,,"Lots of men are good at such kind of skills nowadays. They never treat women with respect. Once they feel bored, they would leave without any guilty.",

SAY.Chapter1.2440.Sophie,,"How to say...... I really appreciate what I learnt here, but I must admit that the life in YIT is not as perfect as people think.",
SAY.Chapter1.2625.Sophie,,People always imagine that we are elites that can achieve anything easily. But who knows what we pay for behind all the successful.,
SAY.Chapter1.2632.Protagonist,,Do you know anything about Prof. Rochester?,

SAY.Chapter1.2635.Sophie,,"Exactly, I used to stay up until 4 A.M. to get a seat, but it's really worthwhile.",

SAY.Chapter1.2706.Sophie,,"I am sorry, but there is no supervisor in my grade named Jennifer. Perhaps you need to ask a faculty.",
SAY.Chapter1.2718.Protagonist,,Do you recognize a professor named Julian Leros? He is another witness.,
SAY.Chapter1.2720.Sophie,,"Oh yes, I know him. I must say that the reason most students choose his class is not for study, his teaching skill is horrible.",
SAY.Chapter1.2725.Protagonist,,How bad it could be?,
SAY.Chapter1.2726.Sophie,,"Like, he always dreams in his own mind? Never explain the concept and assume that everyone can follow him?",
SAY.Chapter1.2727.Sophie,,"I knew he might be good at analyzing or researching, but teaching is totally different. He cannot ask us to be as smart as him.",
SAY.Chapter1.2728.Protagonist,,Then why some students still choose his class?,
SAY.Chapter1.2729.Sophie,,"There are many reasons, instead of study. His grading is very generous even though the test's difficulty is ridiculous. He never check the attendance record......",
SAY.Chapter1.2730.Sophie,,"And the most important, he is chic. Even I don't like his teaching still but I must admit that he is so good looking. Most of his students are girls who still love teen fiction such as Twilight.",

SAY.Chapter1.2466.Protagonist,,"Hey, can I talk more about Rebecca? Do you know what kind of person is she?",
SAY.Chapter1.2468.Anonymous Student,,"Emm...... No that familiar, but I must say I don't like her fans.",
SAY.Chapter1.2469.Anonymous Student,,"Most time is not Rebecca's false, but her fans are really annoying. They don't allow anyone to show critique to Rebecca.",
SAY.Chapter1.2765.Protagonist,,Can you explain it more specifically?,
SAY.Chapter1.2470.Anonymous Student,,"If you say any critical opinion to that Sophie, I swear she will keep pushing you apology untill you surrender. They treat Rebecca as their Queen. That's insane.",
