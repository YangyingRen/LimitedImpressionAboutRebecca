SAY.Chapter1.2810.Protagonist,,Maybe just for your guys safety purpose?,
SAY.Chapter1.2813.Alexia,,"Well, you see the result, somebody still died anyway.",
SAY.Chapter1.2816.Protagonist,,I heard that Rebecca's father used to be the dean of the business school. Is that right?\n,
SAY.Chapter1.2818.Alexia,,Yeah he was. To her advantage as well I'd say.\n,
SAY.Chapter1.2819.Protagonist,,You think the dean being her father gave her special privileges?\n,
SAY.Chapter1.2821.Alexia,,"I mean, if it didn't, why did everyone always turn to her for help?\n",
SAY.Chapter1.2824.,,New Info:\nRebecca might have used her father's position to help students.\n,

SAY.Chapter1.2845.Protagonist,,I agree with you in some way.,
SAY.Chapter1.2846.Alexia,,Their only job on campus is spying on everybody and sow discord between students.,
SAY.Chapter1.2847.Alexia,,This whole system is a catastrophy!,
SAY.Chapter1.2850.Protagonist,,"Did you ever take Prof.Leros's course, how was that?",
SAY.Chapter1.2852.Alexia,,I love his class! It's really helpful!,
SAY.Chapter1.2854.Alexia,,He doesn't really care the real benefit or whether the class is practicle for job hunting. But he's analyzing track is very interesting and innovative.,
SAY.Chapter1.2856.Alexia,,"Sadly, the whole school is so snobby that a good teacher like him cannot show his talent!",

SAY.Chapter1.2951.Protagonist,,"I met a girl looks like Rebecca and she told me her name is Dina, do you know any information about her?",
SAY.Chapter1.2953.Robert,,"Oh Dina, I just met her too. She has changed a lot and I barely can recognize her today if she didn't tell her name.",
SAY.Chapter1.2956.Protagonist,,So she is not always that similar to Rebecca?,
SAY.Chapter1.2955.Robert,,"Back to 2020? no, not at all. She was a very humble and frugal girl. ",
SAY.Chapter1.2957.Robert,,Comparing with her I even feel that Rebecca was too narcissistic. She always want to dress like a beautiful peacock.,
SAY.Chapter1.2958.Robert,,I guess Dina changed after working. The society always ask more for female's appearance. ,
SAY.Chapter1.2961.Protagonist,,Do you know anything about the supervisor Jennifer?,
SAY.Chapter1.2963.Robert,,"Ah, she is not here anymore.",
SAY.Chapter1.2964.Robert,,"I remember after the trial she resigned from the school, as dereliction of duty punishment.",

SAY.Chapter1.2994.Protagonist,,Why? What happened between you and him?,
SAY.Chapter1.2995.Security,,"He almost broke any rule on the student handbook, especially about the curfew time. I  caught him wandering outside after 10 P.M. almost every Friday.",

SAY.Chapter1.2663.Protagonist,,Cannot imagine that we might let a murderer run away.,
SAY.Chapter1.2667.Protagonist,,Jennifer is the student supervisor. I remember I had one supervisor when I was an undergraduate student.,
SAY.Chapter1.2668.Protagonist,,Supervisor is a very embarrasing position in the university. They are not professor nor student but they have the power of managing student's daily life.,
