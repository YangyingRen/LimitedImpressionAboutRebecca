SAY.Chapter1.1395.Protagonist,,我有听闻您为了举办这场追悼会牺牲了自己的职业生涯，大家都感到很惋惜。,I have heard that you sacrificed your career to hold this memorial service. Everyone feels very sorry.
SAY.Chapter1.1396.Robert,,没有什么好惋惜的，失去Rebecca后我已经无心事业了，不如退出来把资源与机会让给别人。,"There is nothing to regret. After losing Rebecca, I am no longer interested in my career. It is better to quit and pass resources and opportunities to others."
SAY.Chapter1.1397.Robert,,Rebecca死后，我即使活着，也不过是形如枯槁，了却残生罢了。,"After Rebecca's death, even though I was alive, I would only look like a withered, but be left alive."
SAY.Chapter1.1398.Protagonist,,请不要这样说，Rebecca也一定是希望您能好好地继续活着。,"Please don't say that, Rebecca must also hope that you can continue to live well."
SAY.Chapter1.1399.Robert,,谢谢你的安慰，我会活着，至少在弄清楚她是怎么死之前我还不可以放弃。,"Thank you for your comfort, I will live, at least I can't give up until I figure out how she died."
SAY.Chapter1.2188.Protagonist,,I found out that still someone believes that Antony is not guilty.,
SAY.Chapter1.2189.Robert,,"Maybe, there are a lots of paradox in the case which are not be solved yet. The worst situation is that the murder might still in this campus.",
SAY.Chapter1.2191.Protagonist,,But who do you think could still insist Antony is innocent?,
SAY.Chapter1.2190.Robert,,"Hard to say, as I know, he didn't have any close friend at that time. The one I could consider is his lawyer.",
SAY.Chapter1.2193.Protagonist,,Wait? You mean Antony's lawyer is here? Today?,
SAY.Chapter1.2192.Robert,,"Yes, she is university's legal advisor for the construction. Guess the president is really content about her achievement - diminishing a severe scandal that almost ruined school's reputation.",
SAY.Chapter1.2196.,,New Info:\nAntony's Lawyer is now university's legal consultant.,
SAY.Chapter1.1317.Protagonist,,我从一些同学的口中得知了这场活动的捐款会用来帮助反对PUA。想必这就是害死您女儿的真凶吧。,I learned from some students that the donations from this event will be used to help oppose PUA. Presumably this is the real culprit who killed your daughter.
SAY.Chapter1.1318.Robert,,看来你一定是与Sophie做了充分沟通，不过这并不是一个好的开始。,"It seems that you must have fully communicated with Sophie, but this is not a good start."
SAY.Chapter1.1320.Protagonist,,您的意思是？Sophie所告诉我的事情并不可信？,What do you mean? What Sophie told me is not credible?
SAY.Chapter1.1321.Robert,,正是如此，我知道有很多人都赞同Antony是杀人凶手这个说法。即使我知道这么想会让我好受一些，可这不符合我一贯严谨的作风。,"I know that many people agree with the statement that Antony is a murderer. Even though thinking like this will make me feel better, it does not conform to my usual rigorous style."
SAY.Chapter1.1323.Robert,,我参加了每一次庭审，每一句证词每一个证物我都记得，检察院仍然缺少关键信息证明他就是凶手。,"I participated in every trial, remembering every testimony, and every exhibit. The procurator still lacked key information to prove that he was the murderer."
SAY.Chapter1.1324.Robert,,作为一名信奉科学的教师，我无法仅凭一些捕风捉影的谣言就给一个孩子扣上杀人犯的罪名。,"As a teacher who believes in science, I cannot convict a child as a murderer based on some rumors."
SAY.Chapter1.1325.Protagonist,,可是这也无法证明他不是凶手是不是？如果他真的清白，为什么这么多年有的学生仍然不愿接受判决结果？,"But this does not prove that he is not the murderer, is it? If he is really innocent, why are some students still reluctant to accept the verdict for so many years?"
SAY.Chapter1.1319.Robert,,我能理解他们这些后辈对Rebecca的崇拜，这层滤镜让他们陷入不理智的狂热。因为他们的偶像死了，所以他们一定要抓出一只替罪羊。,"I can understand the admiration of Rebecca by them. This layer of filter makes them fall into an irrational frenzy. Because their idol is dead, they must catch a scapegoat."
SAY.Chapter1.1326.Robert,,否则他们也不知道如何发泄自己的怒火。即使是受过高等教育的大学生，一旦感性起来也与乌合之众没有什么区别。,Otherwise they don't know how to vent their anger. Even college students who have received higher education are no different from the mob once they become emotional.
SAY.Chapter1.1327.Protagonist,,这话是不是有些冷血？他们可是在为您的女儿鸣不平。,Are these words too cruel? They do their best to grieve your daughter.
SAY.Chapter1.1328.Robert,,我仍然很感谢他们的帮助，只不过他们给不了我想要的真相。,"I still appreciate their help, but they can't give the truth I want."
SAY.Chapter1.1329.Robert,,或许我们任何一个置身其中的人都没有办法找到Rebecca真正的死因。与她的羁绊使我们没有客观看待这个案件。,Perhaps none of us in it can find the real cause of Rebecca's death. The “fetters” with her prevented us from looking at this case objectively.
SAY.Chapter1.1330.Robert,,我们想的最终都是，我们希望她是如何死去。,In the end what we think about is only how we want her to die.
SAY.Chapter1.1331.Protagonist,,所以这就是您向我提问的原因吗？因为我是一个局外人。,So is that why you asked me the question? Because I am an outsider.
SAY.Chapter1.1332.Robert,,有时候局外人更是一种优势。如果我是局外人，或许Rebecca活着的时候我就能发现一些端倪。,"Sometimes outsiders are an advantage. If I were an outsider, maybe I could find some clues while Rebecca was still alive."
SAY.Chapter1.1354.Robert,,你很擅长观察与思考，如果可以的话，请代替我这个不称职的父亲找出Rebecca死亡的真相。,"You are good at observing and thinking. If you can, please find out the truth about Rebecca's death on behalf of me, a incompetent father."
SAY.Chapter1.2049.Robert,,"This is the note I took during the trial, you may need more background information from it.",
SAY.Chapter1.2327.,,New Item:\nYou got the trial transcript.\n,
SAY.Chapter1.1333.Robert,,后天这里将会成为施工现场，同时追悼会也会结束。那一天的早晨，请再来这里告诉我你的结论。,"Ten days later this will become a construction site, and the memorial service will also end. That morning, please come here again and tell me your conclusion."
SAY.Chapter1.1335.Protagonist,,我从媒体方面知道了这是一场不幸的意外。,I learned from the media that this was an unfortunate accident.
SAY.Chapter1.1336.Robert,,这确实是最官方的报道，无论是法院还是学校都支持这个结论。,"This is indeed the most official report, and both the court and the school support this conclusion."
SAY.Chapter1.1338.Robert,,但是，这也是在审判持续半年后陪审团无奈得出的结论。,"However, this is also the conclusion reached by the jury after the trial lasted for half a year."
SAY.Chapter1.1337.Protagonist,,您是说？意外只是因为无法破案的无奈之举？这样做是不是也太草率了？,You mean? The accident was just a helpless act because the case cannot be solved yet? Isn't this too hasty?
SAY.Chapter1.1339.Robert,,持续半年参加陪审可不容易，如果不是毅力非常，普通人很难最后还有力气来对案件进行合理分析。,It is not easy to participate in the jury for half a year. It is difficult for ordinary people to have the strength to analyze the case reasonably under such tired condition.
SAY.Chapter1.1340.Robert,,我想最后他们也放弃了等待检察院所谓的“关键证据”，决定草草结案。,"I think in the end they also gave up waiting for the so-called ""key evidence"" by the procurator and decided to close the case hastily."
SAY.Chapter1.1341.Protagonist,,为什么您觉得就不可能是意外呢？我听闻令嫒去世时可是凌晨，没有看清路不小心失足不是不可能。,"Why do you think it can't be an accident? I heard that it was midnight when Rebecca died, and it was not impossible to accidentally stumble without seeing the road clearly."
SAY.Chapter1.1342.Robert,,我对Rebecca最自豪的一点就是严谨，认真的态度，是个做科研的好苗子。,What I am most proud of about Rebecca is her rigorous and serious. She is a good kid for scientific research.
SAY.Chapter1.1343.Robert,,如果不是有特别重要的事，我想不出有什么需要她半夜三更去湖边玩耍的理由。,"If it weren't for something particularly important, I couldn't think of any reason why she needed to go to the lake to play at the midnight."
SAY.Chapter1.1345.Robert,,尤其第二天她需要作为毕业生代表发表全校演讲，她应该在家认真准备演讲稿才对。,Especially the next day she needs to deliver a school-wide speech as a representative of the graduates. She should prepare the speech carefully at home.
SAY.Chapter1.1344.Protagonist,,所以您认为Rebecca的死是有人有意为之？如果真是这样凶手岂不是还逍遥法外？,"So you think that Rebecca's death was intentional? If this is the case, then the murderer is still free?"
SAY.Chapter1.1346.Robert,,实话实说，我时至今日仍无法下定论，或许作为她的父亲我反而看不清究竟发生了什么。,"To be honest, I still can’t make a conclusion today, maybe as her father I can’t see exactly what happened."
SAY.Chapter1.1347.Robert,,每当我认真思考时，脑子里只会浮现她的笑容。,"Whenever I think seriously, only her smile appears in my mind."
SAY.Chapter1.1348.Protagonist,,那有什么我可以帮到您的吗？我对Rebecca的死也深感惋惜，这样一个优秀的女孩不应该死的不明不白。,Is there anything I can do for you? I also deeply regret the death of Rebecca. Such excellent girl should not die without any reason.
SAY.Chapter1.1349.Robert,,我看的出来你不是一位仅仅为花边新闻而感到满足的人，如果可以的话，请接下我的委托。,"I can see that you are not a person who is only satisfied with gossips. If you can, please accept my commission."
SAY.Chapter1.1355.Robert,,或许你能比我们任何人都更快发现这桩持续了两年的噩梦究竟发生了什么。,"Perhaps you can discover what happened to this nightmare that lasted for two years, faster than any of us."
SAY.Chapter1.2329.Robert,,"This is the note I took during the trial, you may need more background information from it.",

SAY.Chapter1.1434.Protagonist,,调查还没有结束，我还不可以离开这里。,"The Investigation is not over yet, I should still stay here."
SAY.Chapter1.1489.Protagonist,,"I didn't expect the journey to take this long. And with this constant rain, I'm damp all over.\n","I didn't expect that it would take more than an hour to get here. And the rain has been endless, making my whole body smell  musty."
SAY.Chapter1.1490.Protagonist,,"This case better be worth it. My editor thinks it is, but she's not the one travelling out into the wilderness…\n",I hope that the case the editor gave me this time is worth traveling all the way to this wilderness.
SAY.Chapter1.1491.Protagonist,,I should review the information she gave me. Thank god my bag kept it all dry.\n,"That's right, I brought some photocopies of relevant information in my bag."
SAY.Chapter1.1511.Protagonist,,The Daily Post tends to focus on the biggest stories from the city. I remember reading it a lot when I was younger.\n,"Here it is, the Daily Post, a newspaper focusing on the “most important” news in the city. I read a lot when I was a child."
SAY.Chapter1.1512.Protagonist,,"Read carefully and discover what this case is about. (Drag the newspaper with the left mouse key, and investigate with the magnifying glass).\n",Read carefully and figure out what is the case about. ( Drag the newspaper with left mouse key and investigate with the magnifier.)

SAY.Chapter1.2374.Protagonist,,"This is it, the trial transcript. Finally I got a documents that may reveal what happened on that day.",
SAY.Chapter1.2375.Protagonist,,Maybe I could find the next person I want to visit from it.,
SAY.Chapter1.1507.Protagonist,,This isn't relevant to the case.\n,"No, I don't need this now."
SAY.Chapter1.1593.Protagonist,,这些花束又是怎么回事？为什么摆得到处都是。\n难道现在毕业季流行摆白色菊花？虽然看起来有些毛骨悚然，但仔细看却清雅别致，现在的年轻人真是时髦。,"What's with these bouquets? Why are they everywhere? Is it popular to use white chrysanthemums for graduation now? Although it looks a little creepy at first, it does create an elegant and chic feel. Maybe it's a new trend among today's youth."
SAY.Chapter1.1594.Protagonist,,话说回来不愧是新闻上反复强调的一流高校，占地面积很大，简直像一座小型城市。,"Having said that, the campus is worthy of a first-class university that's always making the news. This place looks like a small city."

SAY.Chapter1.2438.Protagonist,,How do you feel about your school life? ,
SAY.Chapter1.2440.Sophie,,"How to say...... I really appreciate what I learnt here, but I must admit that the life in YIT is not as perfect as people think.",
SAY.Chapter1.2625.Sophie,,People always imagine that we are elites that can achieve anything easily. But who knows what we pay for behind all the successful.,
SAY.Chapter1.2632.Protagonist,,Do you know anything about Prof. Rochester?,
SAY.Chapter1.2634.Sophie,,"Well, he was the super star in our department. No kidding, many of my classmates apply this school just want to meet him.",
SAY.Chapter1.2640.Protagonist,,Whao! Then his class should be very hard to enroll I suppose.,
SAY.Chapter1.2635.Sophie,,"Exactly, I used to stay up until 4 A.M. to get a seat, but it's really worthwhile.",
SAY.Chapter1.2643.Protagonist,,"I saw a girl looks really similar to Rebecca, she said her name is Dina, do you know anything about her?",
SAY.Chapter1.2645.Sophie,,"That......impossible? I never heard that somebody in school looks like Rebecca? As far as I know, nobody.",
SAY.Chapter1.2712.Protagonist,,"She said she was Rebecca's roommate, did you ever meet her before?",
SAY.Chapter1.2711.Sophie,,"Oh, I do know her roommate. But that girl's name is Maggie, a very quiet and introvertive person. She cannot be similar to Rebecca, in anyway.",
SAY.Chapter1.2704.Protagonist,,"I heard that one of the witnesses is student supervisor Jennifer, do you know where can I find her?",
SAY.Chapter1.2706.Sophie,,"I am sorry, but there is no supervisor in my grade named Jennifer. Perhaps you need to ask a faculty.",
SAY.Chapter1.2718.Protagonist,,Do you recognize a professor named Julian Leros? He is another witness.,
SAY.Chapter1.2720.Sophie,,"Oh yes, I know him. I must say that the reason most students choose his class is not for study, his teaching skill is horrible.",
SAY.Chapter1.2725.Protagonist,,How bad it could be?,
SAY.Chapter1.2726.Sophie,,"Like, he always dreams in his own mind? Never explain the concept and assume that everyone can follow him?",
SAY.Chapter1.2727.Sophie,,"I knew he might be good at analyzing or researching, but teaching is totally different. He cannot ask us to be as smart as him.",
SAY.Chapter1.2728.Protagonist,,Then why some students still choose his class?,
SAY.Chapter1.2729.Sophie,,"There are many reasons, instead of study. His grading is very generous even though the test's difficulty is ridiculous. He never check the attendance record......",
SAY.Chapter1.2730.Sophie,,"And the most important, he is chic. Even I don't like his teaching still but I must admit that he is so good looking. Most of his students are girls who still love teen fiction such as Twilight.",
SAY.Chapter1.2731.Protagonist,,"{i}(To be honest, I can totally understand those girls. Like, who really take university class for serious study?){/i}",
SAY.Chapter1.2466.Protagonist,,"Hey, can I talk more about Rebecca? Do you know what kind of person is she?",
SAY.Chapter1.2468.Anonymous Student,,"Emm...... No that familiar, but I must say I don't like her fans.",
SAY.Chapter1.2469.Anonymous Student,,"Most time is not Rebecca's false, but her fans are really annoying. They don't allow anyone to show critique to Rebecca.",
SAY.Chapter1.2765.Protagonist,,Can you explain it more specifically?,
SAY.Chapter1.2470.Anonymous Student,,"If you say any critical opinion to that Sophie, I swear she will keep pushing you apology untill you surrender. They treat Rebecca as their Queen. That's insane.",
SAY.Chapter1.2766.Anonymous Student,,"But please don't tell this to anyone, I don't want to bargain with any of them. It's totally waste of time.",
SAY.Chapter1.2768.Protagonist,,Do you know this person?,
SAY.Chapter1.2484.Anonymous Student,,"Sorry, I don't know. Maybe you should find somebody else for asking. ",
SAY.Chapter1.2588.Protagonist,,Why should I have to prove anything to you?\n,
SAY.Chapter1.2589.Security,,"Well then, if really don't want to show me anything -\n",
SAY.Chapter1.2590.Security,,I will happily escort you out myself!\n,
SAY.Chapter1.2597.Protagonist,,I'm here for Professor Rochester. I'm one of his ex-students - I wanted to come and pay respects on the anniversary of Rebecca's passing.\n,
SAY.Chapter1.2598.Security,,A lot of journalists have been hanging around saying the exact same thing.\n,
SAY.Chapter1.2599.Security,,How can I trust that you're not one of them?\n,
SAY.Chapter1.2600.Protagonist,,{i}(They must have had a lot of issues with the press to be this suspicious. How do I get past him?){/i}\n,
SAY.Chapter1.2654.Protagonist,,There is one important witness refused to show during the trial.,
SAY.Chapter1.2655.Protagonist,,If I could find who he or she is then my investigation should make a huge progress.,
SAY.Chapter1.2662.Protagonist,,"Wait, what is this deal? Who deal with that witness?",
SAY.Chapter1.2664.Protagonist,,"Even though this was only policeman's assumption, what about it was true?",
SAY.Chapter1.2663.Protagonist,,Cannot imagine that we might let a murderer run away.,
SAY.Chapter1.2667.Protagonist,,Jennifer is the student supervisor. I remember I had one supervisor when I was an undergraduate student.,
SAY.Chapter1.2668.Protagonist,,Supervisor is a very embarrasing position in the university. They are not professor nor student but they have the power of managing student's daily life.,
SAY.Chapter1.2669.Protagonist,,"No wonder we really hated them at that time. After all, the only thing that 18 years teenagers care are freedom and rebellion.",
SAY.Chapter1.2675.Protagonist,,"Emm......The last time she saw Rebecca was around {color=red} 8 A.M. {/color}, that was definitely over the regular working time.",
SAY.Chapter1.2676.Protagonist,,Why she stayed here at that time? Just waited for Rebecca? ,
SAY.Chapter1.2672.Protagonist,,Julian is the assistant professor and he met Antony at 10 P.M....,
SAY.Chapter1.2673.Protagonist,,Usually assistant professors will do a lot of extra works because they are at the bottom of hierarchy.,
SAY.Chapter1.2686.Protagonist,,"And sometimes those works are really boring, no relationship with their own research at all.",
SAY.Chapter1.2674.Protagonist,,"But 10 P.M. is too late, that is even against the labor law. If the school make him work that late, he need to report to the union.",
SAY.Chapter1.2739.Protagonist,,I missed so much the billboard. You can always find interesting advertisement on it.,
SAY.Chapter1.2741.Protagonist,,It's our secret flea market. You can trade anything with just a short introduction and a couple of your phone number.,
SAY.Chapter1.2740.Protagonist,,I still remember the first page that I sticked on the board is an advertisement of selling English class cheat-sheet.,
SAY.Chapter1.2753.Protagonist,,Every university has a fountain like that. ,
SAY.Chapter1.2754.Protagonist,,"Usually it only turns on when some events happen, like the anniversary or President visit.",
SAY.Chapter1.2755.Protagonist,,I wonder how much YIT pay for this fountain if it runs day and night.,

\n,This behavior smells like a cover-up... does this case have some hidden connection with the school's affairs?,,
