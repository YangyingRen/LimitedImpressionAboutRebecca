SAY.Chapter1.801.Protagonist,,能让这么多人自发为地她哀悼，想必的确是个优秀的人才。,She must have been a figure of some significance for so many people to mourn her spontaneously.

SAY.Chapter1.767.Protagonist,,教育局领导打着让学生远离城市喧嚣，有一方读书净土的名号，实际却因郊外地皮廉价便宜，远离闹市商区学生无处可去，\n就只能乖乖待在校园，管理方便，所以让许多大学移址郊区。,"The Bureau of Education announced that the moves would provide a quiet place to study, but the true reason was that suburban land is cheap, and since students have nowhere to go, they'll tend to stay on the campus. Thus, many universities were moved to the suburbs."
SAY.Chapter1.775.Protagonist,,不过看学校后山这么大一片水域，发生一两件溺亡案件也并不会令人感到意外。,It is not entirely surprising that one or two cases of drowning have occurred when there's such large body of water behind the campus.
SAY.Chapter1.774.Protagonist,,现在我的位置是835号公交车站，连接商学院的大门以及环湖大道。,"My current location is  Bus Stop No. 835, which provides service to the business school and Lake Road."
SAY.Chapter1.776.Protagonist,,大学建筑是环湖而建，沿着湖边一直走就能逛完整个学校，没有建得弯弯绕绕真是帮了大忙。,"The university building is built around the lake, and you can walk around the whole school along the shore."
SAY.Chapter1.787.Protagonist,,黑白画像，是在办悼念会吗？,A black-and-white portrait of the sort you see in funerals... is someone holding a memorial service?

SAY.Chapter1.821.Sophie,,据说Rebecca学姐十分偏爱这片湖的风景，毕业典礼前日凌晨，一定也是想来对这片景色道别吧。,"People say that Rebecca loved the scenery of this lake. She must have wanted to say goodbye to it on that day, in the early morning before her graduation ceremony."
SAY.Chapter1.820.Sophie,,因此才不幸失足落水，葬身于这片平静的湖面，隔日被发现时，身体已经被泡得浮肿了。,"Tragically, she fell and lost her life in these decepitvely calm waters. When she was found the next day, her body was soaked and swollen."
SAY.Chapter1.863.,,New Info:\nRebecca was dead in the midnight.,New Info:\nRebecca was dead in the midnight.
SAY.Chapter1.819.Protagonist,,凌晨？你们学校宿舍没有宵禁吗？我记得我上大学的时候，宿舍11点半就会熄灯锁门。,"Early morning? I take it there's no curfew in your school dorms? When I was in college, the dormitory managers would turn off the lights and lock the doors at 11:30."
SAY.Chapter1.822.Sophie,,我听说Rebecca学姐大学最后一个学期并没有住在宿舍。想必是有什么私人原因吧。,"From what I hear, Rebecca did not live in the dorms in her last semester of school. She must have had her reasons."
MENU.Chapter1.825,,为什么你们到现在才为她举办悼念会?,Why are you only holding a memorial service now?
MENU.Chapter1.826,,为什么要在这里举办悼念会？,Why hold a memorial service here?

SAY.Chapter1.832.Sophie,,最近学校公开宣布，决定在推平湖水后在上面建立新的大楼。,"Recently, the school announced that it will break ground for  a new building on the lake, after draining the water level."
SAY.Chapter1.831.Sophie,,并且所有与Rebecca有交集的学生都将在今年离开校园，于是我们商议后决定在学校开展毕业典礼同时举办悼念会。,"On top of that, all the students who interacted with Rebecca will be gone after this year. So following some discussion, we decided to hold a memorial service before that time's gone and forgotten."
SAY.Chapter1.830.Sophie,,让不幸遇难，没能参加毕业典礼的Rebecca学姐能和我们一起毕业。,"We hope that the unforunate Rebecca,  who failed to attend her own graduation ceremony, can graduate with us."
SAY.Chapter1.834.Protagonist,,一般不都会选择礼堂之类更严肃庄重的室内场地吗？况且还遇到今天下雨，应该会很不方便吧。,"Don’t memorials usually favor more serious indoor venues, such as auditoriums? Besides, things might turn out poorly if it rains today."
SAY.Chapter1.841.Sophie,,学校即将在这里建立的新教学楼，并以Rebecca的名字命名。,The new classroom building that the school will construct here will be named after Rebecca.
SAY.Chapter1.842.Sophie,,并且Rebecca生前十分偏爱湖边的景色，经常在这边晨读散步，所以我们一致认为湖边就是最佳场所。,"In life, Rebecca enjoyed the lakeside scenery very much, and often took morning walks here. So we all agreed that the shore was the best place."
SAY.Chapter1.844.Protagonist,,所以这边才摆放了白色花束。{i}（我还以为是你们年轻人的新潮流）{/i},That's why the white bouquets are placed here. {i}(I thought it was a new trend among young people!){/i}
SAY.Chapter1.847.Sophie,,这些花束同时也是为义卖活动所准备的，仅用十元钱就可以购得Rebecca纪念花束。\n整场悼念会所获得的收入我们会悉数捐献给高校反PUA公益组织。,These bouquets are also prepared for the charity sale. You can purchase Rebecca commemorative bouquets for only ten dollars. We will donate all the income to the anti-PUA charity organization of colleges and universities.

SAY.Chapter1.849.Sophie,,通过反PUA组织能够更有效宣传PUA对女性的迫害，减少更多类似Rebecca学姐这样的惨案发生。,"Through anti-PUA organizations, PUA’s persecution of women can be more effectively promoted, and more tragedies like Rebecca can be reduced."

SAY.Chapter1.1027.Protagonist,,听说你们是跟校方多次交涉才得到了举办权，看来是花费了许多时间和精力，没想到大学生还有这样的组织能力，真是令人惊叹。,I heard that you got the right to host after several negotiations with the school. It took a lot of time and energy. I didn't expect college students to have such organizational skills. It is really amazing.
SAY.Chapter1.1021.Sophie,,您过奖了，没有那么厉害。而且大部分都是学姐的父亲Rochester教授在与学校谈判，我们只不过是帮一些微不足道的忙而已。,"Thank you, it's not that great. And most of negotiation was made by Professor Rochester, Rebecca's father, we are just helping."
SAY.Chapter1.1028.Protagonist,,没想到老师会对学生举办的活动投入心血。,"Unexpectedly, the teacher would devote himself to the activities organized by the students."

SAY.Chapter1.1388.Robert,,你有听到这样的传言吗？这么说并不准确。,Have you heard such rumors? This is not accurate.
SAY.Chapter1.1389.Robert,,Rebecca从来没有主动来求过我，都是我举手之劳而已。,"Rebecca never took the initiative to beg me, it was all my pleasure."
SAY.Chapter1.1390.Protagonist,,为什么？我相信以她的能力应该可以自己解决。,"Why? I believe that with her ability, she should be able to solve it by herself."
SAY.Chapter1.1391.Robert,,或许可以吧。但需要她费时费力才能完成的事我只要几分钟就能完成，何必让她浪费这个时间呢？,"Maybe it can. But I can do things that require her time and effort to complete in just a few minutes, so why let her waste this time?"
SAY.Chapter1.1392.Robert,,不过都是些细枝末节的小事，父亲帮一帮女儿，我觉得无可厚非。,But it's all trivial things. I think it's understandable that father helps daughter.
SAY.Chapter1.1395.Protagonist,,我有听闻您为了举办这场追悼会牺牲了自己的职业生涯，大家都感到很惋惜。,I have heard that you sacrificed your career to hold this memorial service. Everyone feels very sorry.
SAY.Chapter1.1396.Robert,,没有什么好惋惜的，失去Rebecca后我已经无心事业了，不如退出来把资源与机会让给别人。,"There is nothing to regret. After losing Rebecca, I am no longer interested in my career. It is better to quit and pass resources and opportunities to others."
SAY.Chapter1.1397.Robert,,Rebecca死后，我即使活着，也不过是形如枯槁，了却残生罢了。,"After Rebecca's death, even though I was alive, I would only look like a withered, but be left alive."
SAY.Chapter1.1398.Protagonist,,请不要这样说，Rebecca也一定是希望您能好好地继续活着。,"Please don't say that, Rebecca must also hope that you can continue to live well."
SAY.Chapter1.1399.Robert,,谢谢你的安慰，我会活着，至少在弄清楚她是怎么死之前我还不可以放弃。,"Thank you for your comfort, I will live, at least I can't give up until I figure out how she died."
SAY.Chapter1.1317.Protagonist,,我从一些同学的口中得知了这场活动的捐款会用来帮助反对PUA。想必这就是害死您女儿的真凶吧。,I learned from some students that the donations from this event will be used to help oppose PUA. Presumably this is the real culprit who killed your daughter.
SAY.Chapter1.1318.Robert,,看来你一定是与Sophie做了充分沟通，不过这并不是一个好的开始。,"It seems that you must have fully communicated with Sophie, but this is not a good start."
SAY.Chapter1.1320.Protagonist,,您的意思是？Sophie所告诉我的事情并不可信？,What do you mean? What Sophie told me is not credible?
SAY.Chapter1.1321.Robert,,正是如此，我知道有很多人都赞同Antony是杀人凶手这个说法。即使我知道这么想会让我好受一些，可这不符合我一贯严谨的作风。,"I know that many people agree with the statement that Antony is a murderer. Even though thinking like this will make me feel better, it does not conform to my usual rigorous style."
SAY.Chapter1.1323.Robert,,我参加了每一次庭审，每一句证词每一个证物我都记得，检察院仍然缺少关键信息证明他就是凶手。,"I participated in every trial, remembering every testimony, and every exhibit. The procurator still lacked key information to prove that he was the murderer."
SAY.Chapter1.1324.Robert,,作为一名信奉科学的教师，我无法仅凭一些捕风捉影的谣言就给一个孩子扣上杀人犯的罪名。,"As a teacher who believes in science, I cannot convict a child as a murderer based on some rumors."
SAY.Chapter1.1325.Protagonist,,可是这也无法证明他不是凶手是不是？如果他真的清白，为什么这么多年有的学生仍然不愿接受判决结果？,"But this does not prove that he is not the murderer, is it? If he is really innocent, why are some students still reluctant to accept the verdict for so many years?"
SAY.Chapter1.1319.Robert,,我能理解他们这些后辈对Rebecca的崇拜，这层滤镜让他们陷入不理智的狂热。因为他们的偶像死了，所以他们一定要抓出一只替罪羊。,"I can understand the admiration of Rebecca by them. This layer of filter makes them fall into an irrational frenzy. Because their idol is dead, they must catch a scapegoat."
SAY.Chapter1.1326.Robert,,否则他们也不知道如何发泄自己的怒火。即使是受过高等教育的大学生，一旦感性起来也与乌合之众没有什么区别。,Otherwise they don't know how to vent their anger. Even college students who have received higher education are no different from the mob once they become emotional.
SAY.Chapter1.1327.Protagonist,,这话是不是有些冷血？他们可是在为您的女儿鸣不平。,Are these words too cruel? They do their best to grieve your daughter.
SAY.Chapter1.1328.Robert,,我仍然很感谢他们的帮助，只不过他们给不了我想要的真相。,"I still appreciate their help, but they can't give the truth I want."
SAY.Chapter1.1329.Robert,,或许我们任何一个置身其中的人都没有办法找到Rebecca真正的死因。与她的羁绊使我们没有客观看待这个案件。,Perhaps none of us in it can find the real cause of Rebecca's death. The “fetters” with her prevented us from looking at this case objectively.
SAY.Chapter1.1330.Robert,,我们想的最终都是，我们希望她是如何死去。,In the end what we think about is only how we want her to die.
SAY.Chapter1.1331.Protagonist,,所以这就是您向我提问的原因吗？因为我是一个局外人。,So is that why you asked me the question? Because I am an outsider.
SAY.Chapter1.1332.Robert,,有时候局外人更是一种优势。如果我是局外人，或许Rebecca活着的时候我就能发现一些端倪。,"Sometimes outsiders are an advantage. If I were an outsider, maybe I could find some clues while Rebecca was still alive."
SAY.Chapter1.1354.Robert,,你很擅长观察与思考，如果可以的话，请代替我这个不称职的父亲找出Rebecca死亡的真相。,"You are good at observing and thinking. If you can, please find out the truth about Rebecca's death on behalf of me, a incompetent father."
SAY.Chapter1.1333.Robert,,十天后这里将会成为施工现场，同时追悼会也会结束。那一天的早晨，请再来这里告诉我你的结论。,"Ten days later this will become a construction site, and the memorial service will also end. That morning, please come here again and tell me your conclusion."
SAY.Chapter1.1335.Protagonist,,我从媒体方面知道了这是一场不幸的意外。,I learned from the media that this was an unfortunate accident.
SAY.Chapter1.1336.Robert,,这确实是最官方的报道，无论是法院还是学校都支持这个结论。,"This is indeed the most official report, and both the court and the school support this conclusion."
SAY.Chapter1.1338.Robert,,但是，这也是在审判持续半年后陪审团无奈得出的结论。,"However, this is also the conclusion reached by the jury after the trial lasted for half a year."
SAY.Chapter1.1337.Protagonist,,您是说？意外只是因为无法破案的无奈之举？这样做是不是也太草率了？,You mean? The accident was just a helpless act because the case cannot be solved yet? Isn't this too hasty?
SAY.Chapter1.1339.Robert,,持续半年参加陪审可不容易，如果不是毅力非常，普通人很难最后还有力气来对案件进行合理分析。,It is not easy to participate in the jury for half a year. It is difficult for ordinary people to have the strength to analyze the case reasonably under such tired condition.
SAY.Chapter1.1340.Robert,,我想最后他们也放弃了等待检察院所谓的“关键证据”，决定草草结案。,"I think in the end they also gave up waiting for the so-called ""key evidence"" by the procurator and decided to close the case hastily."
SAY.Chapter1.1341.Protagonist,,为什么您觉得就不可能是意外呢？我听闻令嫒去世时可是凌晨，没有看清路不小心失足不是不可能。,"Why do you think it can't be an accident? I heard that it was midnight when Rebecca died, and it was not impossible to accidentally stumble without seeing the road clearly."
SAY.Chapter1.1342.Robert,,我对Rebecca最自豪的一点就是严谨，认真的态度，是个做科研的好苗子。,What I am most proud of about Rebecca is her rigorous and serious. She is a good kid for scientific research.
SAY.Chapter1.1343.Robert,,如果不是有特别重要的事，我想不出有什么需要她半夜三更去湖边玩耍的理由。,"If it weren't for something particularly important, I couldn't think of any reason why she needed to go to the lake to play at the midnight."
SAY.Chapter1.1345.Robert,,尤其第二天她需要作为毕业生代表发表全校演讲，她应该在家认真准备演讲稿才对。,Especially the next day she needs to deliver a school-wide speech as a representative of the graduates. She should prepare the speech carefully at home.
SAY.Chapter1.1344.Protagonist,,所以您认为Rebecca的死是有人有意为之？如果真是这样凶手岂不是还逍遥法外？,"So you think that Rebecca's death was intentional? If this is the case, then the murderer is still free?"
SAY.Chapter1.1346.Robert,,实话实说，我时至今日仍无法下定论，或许作为她的父亲我反而看不清究竟发生了什么。,"To be honest, I still can’t make a conclusion today, maybe as her father I can’t see exactly what happened."
SAY.Chapter1.1347.Robert,,每当我认真思考时，脑子里只会浮现她的笑容。,"Whenever I think seriously, only her smile appears in my mind."
SAY.Chapter1.1348.Protagonist,,那有什么我可以帮到您的吗？我对Rebecca的死也深感惋惜，这样一个优秀的女孩不应该死的不明不白。,Is there anything I can do for you? I also deeply regret the death of Rebecca. Such excellent girl should not die without any reason.
SAY.Chapter1.1349.Robert,,我看的出来你不是一位仅仅为花边新闻而感到满足的人，如果可以的话，请接下我的委托。,"I can see that you are not a person who is only satisfied with gossips. If you can, please accept my commission."
